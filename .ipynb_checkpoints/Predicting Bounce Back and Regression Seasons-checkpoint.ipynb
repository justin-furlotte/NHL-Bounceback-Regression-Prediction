    "The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model which takes as input some player statistics available from https://moneypuck.com, and as output gives a prediction for the number of goals the player scored for that season.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this model is *not* predicting how many goals a player will score next season. Instead, the model is learning how many goals a player *should have scored this season* using statistics, and comparing this prediction with the number of goals the player *actually scored*. An \"underperforming\" player would then be a player who scored less goals than the model predicted they should score, and an \"overperforming\" player would be a player who scored more goals than the model predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we will see that most players who are deemed as underperformers by the model do indeed have bounce back seasons (purely in terms of number of goals scored) the following year, while most overperformers tend to score less goals the following year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model might be useful tool when trying to evaluate, say, the value of a player in a trade (e.g. selling high and buying low), or when determining lists for the NHL entry draft."
