    "The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model which uses data from https://moneypuck.com and, intuitively, attempts to learn how many goals a player \"deserved\" to score in a given season. This is in order to perform outlier detection. An \"underperforming\" player is a player who scored significantly less goals than the model predicted they should score, and an \"overperforming\" player would be a player who scored more goals than the model predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this model is not predicting how many goals a player will score *next* season. Instead, the model is learning how many goals a player *should have scored this season*, and comparing this prediction with the number of goals the player *actually* scored. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we will see that most players who are deemed as underperformers by the model do indeed have bounce back seasons (purely in terms of number of goals scored) the following year, and similarly most overperformers tend to score less goals the following year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model might be useful tool when trying to evaluate, say, the value of a player in a trade (e.g. selling high and buying low), negotiating contracts, or creating draft lists."

    "We have several models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest Regression) which are trained to predicted the number of goals a player scored. \n",

    "Now, let's use each of these models to make a new stacking model (final estimator Ridge) which essentially takes a weighted average \"vote\" between the existing models to predict goals. The new ensemble will train not by rewarding the models that most accurately predict goals, but by rewarding the models which best predict over/underperformers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means we will need to mathematically quantify how well a model predicts under/overperformers. Define $y^0$ to be the goals scored last year, and $y^1$ to be the goals scored this year. Let $p = y^0 - y^0_\\text{pred}$ be the vector difference between the actual goals scored last year and the predicted goals scored last year. \n",

    "- $N$ is the number of correct predictions out of the $|J|$ predictions made by the model, where a \"correct\" prediction $j$ is defined as correctly predicting whether the player $j$ bounces back or regresses next season by at least half of the gap $p_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that the score $\\phi$ is higher when the differences $D_j$ in goals from one year to the next are large, but is slightly decreased by the sigmoid $(1+e^{-N/|J|})^{-1}$ when the model makes incorrect predictions."
